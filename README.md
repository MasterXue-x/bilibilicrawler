# bilibilicrawler
This is a high-school project presented by MasterXue from The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.It is a sample of getting info on bilibili.com via python.
---English version:
the code is put into the repository as a zip. Inside it you can find a series of Python files.I sincerely recommend you to open the whole zip with PyCharm since that is how i created the project. I think i will make a video to explicitly explain the code(hope you can understand Chinese!)
---中文版本
代码放在了zip文件夹里，我推荐直接用PyCharm打开整个文件，因为每个python代码之间联系性很强（就是长的很像）。之后可能会在bilibili出教程，可以搜索“学师傅蛤”关注一下！
